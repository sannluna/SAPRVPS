## Summary

**Working Buttons: 18** ✅
**Failed Buttons: 0** ❌

All Platform Settings and Stream Controls buttons are fully connected to their respective backend endpoints in the standalone server implementation. The errors shown in testing (like "Video not found" or "No video selected") are expected validation errors when prerequisites aren't met, not connection failures.

## Error Handling

All endpoints include proper error handling for:
- Missing required parameters
- Invalid data types
- Database connection issues
- File system errors
- FFmpeg integration problems
- Stream configuration validation

## Notes

1. Video-related buttons require videos to be uploaded first
2. Stream start/restart require both video selection and stream configuration
3. Database backup/restore operations may require application restart
4. RTMP streaming requires FFmpeg to be installed and available
5. All settings changes are immediately persisted to database
6. Frontend settings (theme, auto-refresh) are stored in localStorage
